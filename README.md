# Music-Player-ytm-clone

A little project that I'm doing for fun, it's a music player that will use youtube music API (either I'll use an unofficial one or build one myself) to search for songs and play them. I also have the intention of using the spotify API.

One of the main objectives of this project will be to practice clean code and design patterns, following the SOLID principles and the Clean Architecture. Well, at least I will try to :sweat_smile:.
